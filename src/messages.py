--------------- BEGIN SESSION ---------------
You have connected to a chat server. Welcome!

:: About
Chat is a small piece of server software 
written by Evan Pratten to allow people to 
talk to eachother from any computer as long
as it has an internet connection. (Even an
arduino!). Check out the project at:
https://github.com/Ewpratten/chat

:: Disclaimer
While chatting, keep in mind that, if there 
is a rule or regulation about privacy, this
server does not follow it. All data is sent 
to and from this server over a raw TCP socket
and data is temporarily stored in plaintext
while the server handles message broadcasting

Now that's out of the way so, happy chatting!
