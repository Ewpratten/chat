# chat
ðŸ’¬ Got a telnet client? Come chat!

## Why?
I wanted a very small program that I could use for quick chat sessions without worrying about accounts, support, firewalls, and, OSes.

## Aren't there already programs that do this?
Probably. 

## How do I use it?
```sh
# Server
python3 src -p 6060

# Client
telnet <server IP> 6060
```

## Is it secure?
Not at all. I wanted something small. There aren't even accounts or slash commands. Just chat.

## Cool!
Thanks!
